# ASCII and LSB Data Hiding Techniques

This project demonstrates the implementation of ASCII-based and LSB (Least Significant Bit) data hiding methods on images. The following operations have been performed:

**1. ASCII Data Hiding in Lena Color Image**

- Data Hidden: Name and surname.
- Input Image: 512x512 Lena color image.
- Outputs:
Pixel values before and after hiding.

Histogram of the original and stego images.

**2. ASCII Data Hiding in Peppers Grayscale Image**

- Data Hidden: Student ID.
- Input Image: 512x512 Peppers grayscale image.
- Outputs:
Pixel values before and after hiding.

Histogram of the original and stego images.

**3. LSB (1-bit) Data Hiding in Lena Grayscale Image**

- Data Hidden: Student ID.
- Input Image: 512x512 Lena grayscale image.
- Outputs:

Pixel values before and after hiding.

Histogram of the original and stego images.

**4. LSB (1-bit) Data Hiding in Baboon Color Image**

- Data Hidden: Name and surname.
- Input Image: 512x512 Baboon color image.
- Outputs:

Pixel values before and after hiding.

Histogram of the original and stego images.
